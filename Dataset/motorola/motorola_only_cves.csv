CVE-2023-52160,24-Apr,,CWE-287,"The implementation of PEAP in wpa_supplicant through 2.10 allows authentication bypass. For a successful attack, wpa_supplicant must be configured to not verify the network's TLS certificate during Phase 1 authentication, and an eap_peap_decrypt vulnerability can then be abused to skip Phase 2 authentication. The attack vector is sending an EAP-TLV Success packet instead of starting Phase 2. This allows an adversary to impersonate Enterprise Wi-Fi networks.",2.10,2024-02-22T17:15:08.263,2024-03-10T04:15:06.897,cvssMetricV31,NETWORK,LOW,NONE,REQUIRED,HIGH,NONE,NONE,6.5,MEDIUM,Improper Authentication,2024,04,2024-04-01
