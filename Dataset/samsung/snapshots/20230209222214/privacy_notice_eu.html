			  <strong>HOW LONG DO WE RETAIN YOUR INFORMATION AND WHERE DOES IT GO?</strong>
			  <ol>
                <li>How long your data will be retained depends on the legal basis relied upon to process your data. For example, data we process to perform our contract with you requires us to keep the data throughout the time you use the Rewards Program.

                <li>Please note, although we aim to retain your data for the time period described above, your data may be processed longer pursuant to applicable law. For example, if a specific statute mandates we require a certain piece of data, we will comply and retain that data until the required retention period expires.</li>
                <li>As long as your data is retained by us your data will always be subject to appropriate safeguards.</li>
                <li>Your use of the Rewards Program will involve the transfer, storage, and processing of your personal information to other countries; such countries include, without limitation, countries in the European Economic Area, Republic of Korea and United States of America.
