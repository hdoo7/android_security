			  <strong>HOW LONG DO WE RETAIN YOUR INFORMATION AND WHERE DOES IT GO?</strong>
			  <ol>
                <li>How long your data will be retained depends on the legal basis relied upon to process your data. For example, data we process to perform our contract with you requires us to keep the data throughout the time you use the Rewards Program. As long as you are an active user of the Rewards Program, we will retain and process this data. Data such as your account information and device information and identifiers fall into this category.</li>
                <li>Data we process to promote our business interests, such as your usage of the Rewards Program, is only kept for as long as needed for the purposes for which it was collected. For example, this data may be collected to perform analytics so we can develop improvements to the Rewards Program, or we may process data to keep a record of inquiries you made through or about the Rewards Program to improve your customer service experience.</li>
                <li>Please note, although we aim to retain your data for the time period described above, your data may be processed longer pursuant to applicable law. For example, if a specific statute mandates we require a certain piece of data, we will comply and retain that data until the required retention period expires.</li> 
                <li>As long as your data is retained by us your data will always be subject to appropriate safeguards.</li>
                <li>Your use of the Rewards Program will involve the transfer, storage, and processing of your personal information to other countries; such countries include, without limitation, countries in the Republic of Korea and United States of America. All international data transfers are subject to legal requirements to ensure that your personal information is processed safely and as you would expect. Such measures include the use of Standard Contractual Clauses to safeguard the transfer of data outside of the EEA.
